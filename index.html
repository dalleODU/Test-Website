      <h1>Our Problem Statement</h1>
      <p>Many young professionals in the U.S. struggle with their finances
          due to the overwhelming burden of student loans,
          ever increasing credit rates,
            and a lack of experience with crucial financial skills.</p>
      <p>
        Balancing the pressures of starting a career while facing financial uncertainty leads to the accumulation of debt,
          increased anxiety, and delayed life milestones such as marriage,
          home ownership, and starting a family.
      </p>
      <p>
        CreditTrax aims to empower young professionals with personalized budgeting and debt management tools designed to simplify
          financial decisions, enhance financial literacy, and set young professionals back on track for financial success.
